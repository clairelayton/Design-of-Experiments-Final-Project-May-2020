# Design-of-Experiments-Final-Project-May-2020
My final project for STA4211 Design of Experiments. The project was titled, "Effects of Demographic Factors on Acceptance Rates Among Rushes of the Tau Chapter of Alpha Phi Omega at the University of Florida". The project's goal was to identify recruitment and admission biases in the Tau Chapter of Alpha Phi Omega, a national co-ed service fraternity. See the "STA4211 Final Project" Word document to see further details and project analysis.
